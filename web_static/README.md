# AirBnB Clone v3 Web Static

This directory contains the static HTML and CSS for the early HBnB UI.

## Structure

- `images/` – Icons and logo used in pages
- `styles/` – CSS stylesheets (variants for each milestone)
- `0-index.html ... 8-index.html` – Progressive versions of the landing page

## Usage

Open any of the `*-index.html` files in your browser directly, for example:

```bash
xdg-open 0-index.html  # Linux
```

Or serve the folder with your favorite static server or Nginx.

> [!TIP]
> The dynamic Flask version of the UI lives under `web_flask/` and integrates with storage.
